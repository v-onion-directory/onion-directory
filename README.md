## Understanding Onion Directories

Onion directories act as search engines for the darknet, compiling lists of .onion links for various services, forums, and markets. Accessing and using them requires Tor Browser to ensure anonymity. A well-chosen onion directory provides a safer way to discover resources, reducing the risk of stumbling upon malicious sites or phishing attempts.
